# My Serverless Application

This is a serverless application deployed using the Serverless Framework.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Serverless Framework

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

### AWS Credentials

Ensure that you have your AWS credentials configured locally. You can set this up by running:

    aws configure

## Key points:

1. **Scripts**: 
    - `npm run start`: Uses `serverless offline start` to start the local server.
    - `npm run test`: Runs Jest for testing.

2. **Local Development**: Leverages `serverless-offline` for running the application locally. The `swagger` documentation can be accessed locally as well.

This documentation can serve as a good foundation for your project and can be customized as your application evolves.
